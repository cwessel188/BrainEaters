DONE ======================================================================
- remove players from the board when they disconnect.
- remove a player on disconnect
- create a method to move any object
	the player and zomies will both call this
BUGS ======================================================================
When two clients are opened at the same time, they control the same player.
	this is caused by using client id as the player id

assigning plrchar based on the length of the player array is a bad idea.

padding not equal from the sprites to the end of the map
