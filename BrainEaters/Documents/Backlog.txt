BUGS ======================================================================

assigning plrchar based on the length of the player array is a bad idea.

online, pushing down right silumtaneously occasionally results in a second icon appearing.

occasionally players from differenct connections will control the same icon  .

FIXED =====================================================================
- added 'tabindex="1"', which allow the canvas to be in focus and captures the listener
	so that chat messages no longer mode the players

- padding not equal from the sprites to the end of the map

- When two clients are opened at the same time, they control the same player.
	this is caused by using client id as the player id
