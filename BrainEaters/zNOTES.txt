two implementations: 

javascript, all front end ajax
c# serverside, clients connect through signalR

create single instance of game. DONE 
	singleton pattern
	thread safe constructor

brainEatersGame is a threadsafe singleton, with a lock to prevent multiple instances being created.

DONE singleton
 game is still creating multiple version fo the board
 handle singleton login in hub?
 controller? client?
 what all accesses the game? should i be passing the singleton into methods?
 am i passing singletons into methods?

 NEXT (as of 5.30):
	implement player creation
	FIXED addPlayer method is written but never called

	5.30
	added primitive player support
	adds a player with ID based on the length of the player array
	game persists across multiple clients
TODO implement client IDs DONE 5.31
	
TODO create and enum with all the characters
 z f - 0 1

 CURRENTLY:
	the clients add thier own player to the game object
	id is numplayers++
	need to update teh move player method so that it accepts a player FIXED 5.31 
	-> move player breaks because its looking for '0' and can't find it. FIXED 5.31 

FIXED 5.31 BUG: chrome calls the add player method an extra time when the address is pasted into the omnibar


NEXT 5.31:
prompt users for their name
handle collision between the players and other objects 
	^ this is a pretty big thing

6.10
refactored player movement methods in preparation for other entities moving and handling collisions

create a method to move any object
	the player and zomies will both call this

handle zombie movement

Wish List:
 - add names to players and display them on the side along with their sprites.
 - remove players from the board when they disconnect.
 - host on azure
 - walls
 - sprite animations
 - unit testing
 - test the singleton for threadsafety
