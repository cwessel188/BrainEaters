two implementations: 

javascript, all front end ajax
c# serverside, clients connect through signalR

*******  TODO Split into two projects


DONE create single instance of game. 
	singleton pattern
	thread safe constructor

brainEatersGame is a threadsafe singleton, with a lock to prevent multiple instances being created.

DONE singleton
 game is still creating multiple version fo the board
 handle singleton login in hub?
 controller? client?
 what all accesses the game? should i be passing the singleton into methods?
 am i passing singletons into methods?

 NEXT (as of 5.30):
	implement player creation
	DONE addPlayer method is written but never called




	5.30
	added primitive player support
	adds a player with ID based on the length of the player array
	game persists across multiple clients
TODO implement client IDs
	
TODO create and enum with all the characters
 z f - 0 1

 CURRENTLY:
	the clients add thier own player to the game object
	id is numplayers++
	need to update teh move player method so that it accepts a player
	-> move player breaks because its looking for '0' and can't find it.

BUG: chrome calls the add player method when the address is pasted into the omnibar
